# HEXOMAP: High Energy X-ray Orientation Mapping

__HEXOMAP__ is a Cuda-based (realized through pycuda) near-filed high-energy
X-ray diffraction ([NF-HEDM](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/suter/3dxdm/3dxdm.html))
reconstruction toolkit that provides 3D microstructure reconstructed with high
fadelity and efficiency.

> NOTE:  
> This GPU-based reconstruction toolkit is currently under development, and
> the API is subjected to change in the final stable realse (tentative date
> is scheduled around summer 2019).

## Installation

## Usage and Examples

## Roadmap
* Public release with stable API by the end of summer, 2019.
* Add efficient foward NF/FF-HEDM simulation toolkit with dedicated GUI/Web frontend.
